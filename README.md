## About CodeTogether
CodeTogether is a pair programming tool specifically designed around quick organic sessions, like a quick Slack or Hangout call. It is highly optimized for coding with participants connecting in from any modern browser and able to have a realtime coding experience even if connecting from the other side of the world. Anyone developing in VS Code or Eclipse can start using CodeTogether simply by installing an extension or plugin.

### Stay in Your IDE
Make real time edits to code shared by the hostâ€™s IDE using a browser-based editor. Eclipse and VS Code support now available, other IDEs coming soon.

### Easy to Use
CodeTogether makes it simple to collaborate with others. Just share a link and with a click of the mouse, teammates see your project in a browser.

### Nondisruptive
Collaborators interact with the project without interrupting the workflow of others. The session host can continue to use other applications even if participants are actively coding.

### Participants Code Too!
Participants can take control and code right from the browser with content assist, code navigation, references, and searching in the workspace.

### Stay in Control
Everyone in the session gets to control who they choose to follow, whether the host or other participants, to see exactly what teammates are discussing.

### Integrates Well
Our goal is to improve your development process, not upset it. CodeTogether is a nice complement to popular tools you might use already, like Slack or MS Teams.
