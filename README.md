Great for remote teams that need to collaborate, even when using different IDEs. [CodeTogether](https://www.codetogether.com) is available for IntelliJ, Eclipse and VS Code. Host a collaborative session from any supported IDE, and participants can join from their preferred IDE or a browser. Source is always [End-to-End Encrypted](https://www.codetogether.com/download/security/) and [on-premises](https://www.codetogether.com/docs/on-premises-faq) hosting is optionally available. Host-based intelligence ensures everyone gets the language smarts needed for capabilities such as content assist and validation, regardless of how they join the session.

## Key Features
<div class="tg-wrap"><table>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>No vendor lock-in</td>
    <td>Host or join a pair programming session from Eclipse, IntelliJ or VS Code. Simply share the session’s link with anyone you like. They join the session from either their local IDE (even if it’s different from yours) or a web browser (with the theme and key bindings of their preferred IDE).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Host-provided language smarts</td>
    <td>CodeTogether participants benefit from the host IDE’s language smarts. Even if you join from a browser or an IDE with a different configuration, you still get key features like content assist and as-you-type validation across the workspace.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Code together or alone</td>
    <td>CodeTogether makes it easy to switch between groups of developers coding together, or code on your own during a session. Developers can even edit the same file at the same time, just like in Google Docs. The CodeTogether view gives a nice overview of the session so you can quickly see who’s doing what, and jump into a new group or branch out on your own.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Always secure</td>
    <td>The project remains on the host computer and only required data is relayed to participants and the CodeTogether backend using full end-to-end encryption. An on-premises version that keeps all source behind your firewall is also available.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
